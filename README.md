# Assignment Replica — React + Vite + Tailwind

This project is a polished replica of the requested assignment. It focuses on laptop screens (>=768px) where the left half is intentionally empty and two right-side widgets are the main focus.

Features:
- Tabs widget with three clickable tabs (About me, Experiences, Recommended)
- Gallery widget with "Add image" button, multiple image upload, preview and remove
- Images persisted in `localStorage`
- Responsive for laptop screens and above
- Tailwind CSS for styling, with enhanced shadows and spacing for a polished look
